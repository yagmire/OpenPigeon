## Not distributed with this repository

**Player.IO Android SDK** - `app/libs/PlayerIO.aar`

Proprietary. The Player.IO Terms of Service prohibit redistribution of their
software, so the binary is not included in this repository.

Used only by Crazy 8 multiplayer. All other games build and run without it.

To build Crazy 8 multiplayer, obtain the SDK yourself from
<https://playerio.com> and place it at `app/libs/PlayerIO.aar`. You will need
your own Player.IO account; accounts are not transferable. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Engine and libraries

**Godot Engine** - MIT License
<https://godotengine.org/license>

**godot-box2d** - MIT License
`app/src/main/assets/addons/godot-box2d/`
See `LICENSE.txt` and `THIRDPARTY.txt` in that directory. Those files must not
be removed.

**Box2D** - MIT License
`app/src/main/cpp/box2d` (git submodule)

**Android Game Development Kit (Swappy frame pacing)** - Apache License 2.0
`app/src/main/java/com/google/androidgamesdk/`
<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/gamesdk/+/refs/heads/main/games-frame-pacing/extras/>

`ChoreographerCallback.java` and `SwappyDisplayManager.java` are vendored
verbatim from AGDK. Godot statically links Swappy's native half and looks these
classes up by name; shipping them keeps Swappy off its in-memory DEX fallback,
which hardened Android builds block. See the header comments in those files.
